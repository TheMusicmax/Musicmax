# Development Environment

**Musicmax** uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into the latest stable
version of Android Studio (available [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)). The `debug`
build can be built and run using the default configuration.

# Build

The app contains the usual `debug` and `release` build variants.

In addition, the `benchmark` variant of `app` is used to test startup performance and generate a
baseline profile (see below for more information).

For normal development use the `debug` variant. For UI performance testing use the `release`
variant.

# Architecture

The **Musicmax** app follows the
[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

![Architecture diagram](docs/images/architecture-graph.png)

# Modularization

The **Musicmax** app has been fully modularized.

# UI

The app was designed using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/).

The Screens and UI elements are built entirely
using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

The app has two themes:

- Dynamic color - uses colors based on
  the [user's current color theme](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) (if supported)
- Default theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported

Each theme also supports dark mode.

# Baseline profiles

The baseline profile for this app is located
at [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt). It contains rules that enable
AOT compilation of the critical user path taken during app launch. For more information on baseline
profiles, read [this document](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/baselineprofiles).

> **Note**: The baseline profile needs to be re-generated for release builds that touch code which changes app startup.

To generate the baseline profile, select the `benchmark` build variant and run the
`BaselineProfileGenerator` benchmark test on an AOSP Android Emulator. Then copy the resulting
baseline profile from the emulator
to [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt).

# Localization

**Musicmax** uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) as a localization management platform and is available on Crowdin at [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/musicmax-android).
